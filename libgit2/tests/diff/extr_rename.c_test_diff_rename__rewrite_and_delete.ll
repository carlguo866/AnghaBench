were--the guardrooms of them gilded,\0A-And garrisoned with Amazons invincible in war.\0A-\0A-All the world went softly when it walked before my Cities--\0A-Neither King nor Army vexed my peoples at their toil,\0A-Never horse nor chariot irked or overbore my Cities,\0A-Never Mob nor Ruler questioned whence they drew their spoil.\0A-\0A-Banded, mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset;\0A-Singing while they sacked it, they possessed the land at large.\0A-Yet when men would rob them, they resisted, they made onset\0A-And pierced the smoke of battle with a thousand-sabred charge.\0A-\0A-So they warred and trafficked only yesterday, my Cities.\0A-To-day there is no mark or mound of where my Cities stood.\0A-For the River rose at midnight and it washed away my Cities.\0A-They are evened with Atlantis and the towns before the Flood.\0A-\0A-Rain on rain-gorged channels raised the water-levels round them,\0A-Freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their world from sight,\0A-Till the emboldened floods linked arms and, flashing forward, drowned them--\0A-Drowned my Seven Cities and their peoples in one night!\0A-\0A-Low among the alders lie their derelict foundations,\0A-The beams wherein they trusted and the plinths whereon they built--\0A-My rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations,\0A-Dead, destroyed, aborted, and defiled with mud and silt!\0A-\0A-The Daughters of the Palace whom they cherished in my Cities,\0A-My silver-tongued Princesses, and the promise of their May--\0A-Their bridegrooms of the June-tide--all have perished in my Cities,\0A-With the harsh envenomed virgins that can neither love nor play.\0A-\0A-I was Lord of Cities--I will build anew my Cities,\0A-Seven, set on rocks, above the wrath of any flood.\0A-Nor will I rest from search till I have filled anew my Cities\0A-With peoples undefeated of the dark, enduring blood.\0A+I WAS LORD OF CITIES VERY SUMPTUOUSLY BUILDED.\0A+SEVEN ROARING
